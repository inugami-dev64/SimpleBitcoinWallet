# Simple Bitcoin wallet

This repository contains source code for the client-side wallet program as a part of our project in which we attempt to implement a simplified version of the Bitcoin protocol.
The project serves mostly as an educational tool to better understand blockchain technology and how Bitcoin protocol works in detail.

In order to use the wallet you'll need to have at least one node present. The Bitcoin node server implementation can be found at 
[SimpleBitcoinNode](https://github.com/TheGreyCore/SimpleBitcoinNode) repository.
